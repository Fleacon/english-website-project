          <p>
            Education has emerged as one of the most significant predictors of voting behavior in the United States. In recent years, particularly
            since the rise of Donald Trump, the divide between college-educated and non-college-educated voters has widened, shaping the political
            landscape in profound ways.
          </p>

          <h3>The Role of Education in Voting Behavior</h3>
          <h4>College-Educated Voters</h4>
          <div class="merkmaleliste">
            <div class="merkmal">College graduates are more likely to support the Democratic Party.</div>
            <div class="merkmal">They tend to have higher incomes and are often more exposed to diverse viewpoints through their education.</div>
            <div class="merkmal">
              Issues like climate change, social justice, and healthcare resonate strongly with this demographic, aligning with Democratic policies.
            </div>
          </div>
          <br />
          <h4>Non-College-Educated Voters</h4>
          <div class="merkmaleliste">
            <div class="merkmal">Those without a college degree tend to support the Republican Party.</div>
            <div class="merkmal">
              This group often experiences economic challenges and resonates with Republican messaging on issues like job security, nationalism, and
              traditional values.
            </div>
            <div class="merkmal">
              Republican leaders, including Trump, have effectively appealed to the frustrations and concerns of this demographic, particularly in
              rural and industrial areas.

          <h3>Accelerated Divide</h3>
          <p>
            Donald Trump’s presidency accelerated this educational divide. His campaign strategies targeted non-college-educated voters by addressing
            their economic anxieties, opposition to political elites, and concerns over immigration and globalization. Meanwhile, college-educated
            voters increasingly aligned with Democratic values, rejecting Trump’s rhetoric on social issues and embracing progressive causes.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Education in Swingstates</h3>
          <p>
            Swing states hold a critical role in determining the outcome of elections, and their unique balance of college-educated and
            non-college-educated voters makes them highly contested battlegrounds. States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin often exhibit
            near-equal splits between these two demographic groups, creating an intense focus from both parties. The balance in these states means
            that appealing to just one of these groups can significantly shift the outcome of an election. Political campaigns invest heavily in swing
            states, tailoring messages that resonate with both college-educated voters, who tend to favor progressive policies, and
            non-college-educated voters, who are often drawn to messages emphasizing economic security and traditional values. This dynamic makes
            swing states pivotal in shaping the direction of national elections.
