          <p>
            Religion has long been one of the most reliable predictors of voting behavior in the United States. For many voters, their political
            preferences are deeply tied to their religious beliefs, particularly on social and moral issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and even
            economic policies. The influence of religion on voting varies by faith, denomination, and the level of religious engagement, making it a
            powerful force in shaping political landscapes.
          </p>

          <h3>Religion as a Predictor for voting Behavior</h3>
          <p>
            Religious affiliation and the degree of faith observance significantly influence voter choices. Many people align their political
            decisions with their religious values, using their faith as a moral compass to evaluate candidates and policies. This connection is most
            apparent in debates over contentious issues like reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ equality, where faith-based teachings often guide
            opinions.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Religious Groups and Party Alignment</h3>
          <p>Different religious communities exhibit distinct political tendencies:</p>
          <div class="vergleichliste">
            <div class="vergleich">
              <strong>Jewish and Catholic Voters</strong>: These groups traditionally lean toward the Democratic Party, largely due to shared
              priorities like social justice, economic equality, and immigration reform.
            </div>
            <div class="vergleich">
              <strong>Evangelical Protestants</strong>: Evangelicals are strong supporters of the Republican Party, aligning with its conservative
              stances on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and religious freedom.
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
            <p>
              Evangelicals are especially notable for the degree to which their faith influences their voting behavior, often prioritizing their
              religious values above other considerations. On the other hand, non-evangelical Christians—such as mainline Protestants and Orthodox
              Christians—tend to incorporate their faith into their decisions while also factoring in broader concerns, such as economic policy or
              environmental issues. For non-Christians, media and other cultural influences often have a greater impact than religion itself,
              reflecting a broader, more secular approach to politics.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Religion and Political Ideology</h3>
            <p>
              Religious influence is stronger among conservatives than among liberals or moderates. For many conservative voters, faith is central to
              their worldview and directly shapes their preferences on candidates and policies. Liberals, while often guided by moral principles that
              may be rooted in faith, are typically influenced by other factors, such as education or cultural norms, when making political decisions.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Churches and Religious Leaders</h3>
            <p>
              Churches and pastors hold significant potential to influence voter behavior, especially if they actively engage with political issues.
              By addressing topics like social justice, economic inequality, or moral dilemmas from a faith perspective, religious leaders can shape
              their congregants' views and encourage political participation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img src="./assets/church.jpg" alt="" />
            <br />
            <p>
              While some argue that churches should remain apolitical, others believe that faith-based institutions have a moral responsibility to
              guide their communities in making decisions that align with their values. Greater involvement from churches, particularly in rural and
              evangelical communities, could potentially shift voter behavior on a broader scale.
