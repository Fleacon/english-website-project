          <p>
            Everyone has their reasons for voting. People vote based on a variety of personal, emotional, or practical considerations, but sometimes
            these reasons may not align with what would actually benefit them or their communities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="merkmaleliste">
            <p>
              There are several reasons why someone might vote in a way that doesn't align with their own best interest. Some of these reasons might
              be out of their control, while others stem from personal beliefs or feelings.
              <br />
              Some of the Reasons could be:
            </p>
            <div class="merkmal">They don’t have all the facts.</div>
            <div class="merkmal">They feel pressured by family, community, or cultural beliefs.</div>
            <div class="merkmal">They vote based on emotions or mistrust of politicians, rather than logic and facts.</div>
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h3>How Different Groups Are Affected</h3>
          <p>
            Each group of voters has unique concerns and interests, and sometimes those concerns don't always align with their own best interests.
            Below are examples of how various groups may vote in ways that don't always reflect their needs.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4>Immigrants</h4>
          Immigrants, like any other demographic, care deeply about policies that affect their lives. They are often concerned with fair immigration
          laws, protection from discrimination, and ensuring their families have access to good opportunities.
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for their interests:</strong> Supporting parties that advocate for fair immigration policies, social justice, and
            protection from discrimination aligns with their interests. These policies offer better opportunities, legal security, and social
            benefits.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting against their interests:</strong> Some immigrants support stricter immigration policies due to religious beliefs, promises
            about jobs, financial concerns, or a desire to fit in socially.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Queer Communities</h4>
          <p>
            For many in the queer community, voting is heavily influenced by the desire for equal rights, recognition, and safety in society. However,
            their voting choices sometimes don’t reflect the policies that would most benefit them.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Queer individuals often vote for policies that protect their rights, such as
            anti-discrimination laws, healthcare access, and marriage equality. Supporting parties that advocate for inclusivity and equal treatment
            directly benefits the queer community.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some queer individuals may vote for parties that don’t prioritize LGBTQ+ rights,
            based on other factors like economic concerns or religious beliefs. This can happen when voters feel their economic situation is more
            pressing than their civil rights or when they are influenced by family or social pressures that conflict with their personal identity.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Low-Income Voters</h4>
          <p>
            Economic status is one of the most influential factors in voting behavior, but it doesn't always lead to decisions that benefit an
            individual’s financial well-being.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Low-income individuals are more likely to vote for parties that promise higher social safety
            nets, healthcare programs, and minimum wage increases. These policies are designed to lift people out of poverty and improve their
            standard of living.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some low-income individuals vote for conservative parties that advocate for
            lower taxes and reduced government spending. This could be because of a belief in "trickle-down economics," where economic growth benefits
            everyone, or because they are influenced by cultural or social factors that override economic concerns.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Wealthier Voters</h4>
          <p>
            Wealthier individuals, particularly those who have benefited from economic policies favoring deregulation and tax cuts, tend to vote in
            ways that align with their financial interests.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong> Wealthier individuals often support policies that lower taxes, reduce regulations, and
            promote business-friendly environments. These policies benefit them financially and help maintain their economic status.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some wealthier voters support policies that benefit the general population, such
            as increased social welfare or taxes on the wealthy. This can happen due to moral reasons, political alignment, or social values, despite
            these policies not necessarily benefitting their own financial interests.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Women</h4>
          <p>Women are an important voting group, with many considering issues related to reproductive rights, healthcare, and gender equality.</p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Women are more likely to vote for policies that address issues such as healthcare access,
            equal pay, family leave, and reproductive rights. These policies directly benefit women's independence, health, and safety.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some women vote for parties that oppose reproductive rights or gender equality,
            often due to religious beliefs, social pressures, or a prioritization of economic issues over gender-based policies.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Men</h4>
          <p>
            Men, particularly in certain regions, tend to vote with different priorities than women, often influenced by values such as national
            security, economic policies, and traditional social roles.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Men, especially in working-class communities, may support policies that favor job creation,
            economic growth, and lower taxes. These policies directly benefit men by supporting employment opportunities and financial stability.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some men vote for policies that prioritize national security or tax cuts, which
            may benefit the wealthy but don't always address broader social concerns that might help men in more vulnerable situations, such as
            healthcare access or support for single fathers.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Young Voters</h4>
          <p>
            Younger voters are often more focused on social issues, such as climate change, education reform, and social justice, and tend to vote
            more progressively.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Young voters support policies that promote climate action, affordable education, and social
            justice reform. These issues are directly relevant to their futures, addressing concerns about sustainability and equality.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some younger voters may choose more conservative candidates due to economic
            concerns or family influence, even when those candidates do not prioritize progressive social issues like climate change or student loan
            reform.
          </div>
          <hr />
          <h4>Older Voters</h4>
          <p>
            Older voters, particularly those who have experienced the benefits of social programs like Social Security and Medicare, tend to focus on
            policies that ensure the continuation of these services.
          </p>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting for Their Interests: </strong>Older voters are more likely to support policies that protect Social Security, Medicare, and
            healthcare access. These programs are vital for their financial security and health.
          </div>
          <div class="vergleich">
            <strong>Voting Against Their Interests: </strong>However, some older voters support candidates or parties that propose cuts to social
            programs in favor of tax cuts or reducing government spending, potentially putting their own benefits at risk due to ideological beliefs
            or concerns over national debt.
